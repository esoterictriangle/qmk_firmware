set_single_persistent_default_layer(layer) to set a default on keyboard plug in; prolly wanna make this qwerty (may or may not need this)

TAPPING_TOGGLE may need to be moved to config instead of the keymap

If I'm gonna do emoji I need to remember to enable UNICODEMAP_ENABLE or similar in rules.mk

I can remove the RESET key since there are reset buttons soldered to the pcb

georgepetri has some rgb code for layers I might want to refer to

this goes in config for rgb:
#undef RGBLED_NUM 
#define RGBLED_NUM 12 //change to # of LEDs
#define RGBLED_SPLIT { 6, 6 } //define which half has how many LEDs

there's a pin for LED on the L board--12 (9/PB5 on the ProMicro)--should be able to hook this one into lighting for caps lock--link LED to the hole on the board and to either GND or VCC

this code should enable caps lock LED (and would go inside keymap?); I don't understand what makes this example inverted, though.

bool led_update_kb(led_t led_state) {
    bool res = led_update_user(led_state);
    if(res) {
        // writePin sets the pin high for 1 and low for 0.
        // In this example the pins are inverted, setting
        // it low/0 turns it on, and high/1 turns the LED off.
        // This behavior depends on whether the LED is between the pin
        // and VCC or the pin and GND.
        writePin(B5, !led_state.caps_lock); //B5 should be the LED pin I think lol
    }
    return res;
}

this one is the code for starting RGB after everything else has loaded:

void keyboard_post_init_user(void) {}
